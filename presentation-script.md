## Architecture Overview (8-10 minutes)

### System Architecture Deep Dive
"Let me start with the high-level architecture. BetterUptime follows a microservices pattern with 5 core services:

#### 1. Frontend Service - Next.js Application
The frontend is built with Next.js 15 using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. This serves as the user interface for our dashboard, authentication system, and website management. The key features include server-side rendering for optimal performance, responsive design with dark and light mode support, real-time updates using polling mechanisms, and progressive web app capabilities.

The frontend handles user authentication, displays monitoring dashboards, manages website configurations, and provides detailed analytics views. It's designed with a mobile-first approach and includes comprehensive error handling and loading states.

#### 2. API Service - Express.js Backend
The API service is the central hub built with Express.js and TypeScript, implementing JWT-based authentication. This RESTful API handles all business logic and provides endpoints for user signup and signin, website management with full CRUD operations, bulk website retrieval for dashboard display, detailed monitoring data access, and health check endpoints for system monitoring.

The API implements comprehensive input validation using Zod schemas, proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes, CORS configuration for cross-origin requests, and middleware for authentication and request logging.

#### 3. Pusher Service - Job Orchestration
The Pusher service acts as the heartbeat of our monitoring system. Built with Bun runtime for optimal performance, it runs every 30 seconds to fetch all websites from the database and push monitoring jobs to Redis streams using bulk operations for efficiency.

This service implements graceful error handling, proper cleanup on termination signals, and monitoring of its own health status. It's designed to be stateless and can be scaled horizontally if needed.

#### 4. Worker Service - Multi-Region Monitoring
The Worker services are the actual monitoring engines, currently supporting India and USA regions. Each worker consumes jobs from Redis streams using consumer groups, makes HTTP requests to target websites, records response times and status information, handles timeouts and error scenarios gracefully, and acknowledges processed messages to ensure reliability.

Workers are designed for high concurrency, processing multiple websites simultaneously while maintaining proper resource management and error isolation.

#### 5. Database Layer - PostgreSQL and Redis
The database layer consists of PostgreSQL as the primary database with Prisma ORM for type-safe database operations, and Redis for streams and caching. The schema is normalized with proper relationships, uses UUID primary keys for better distribution, and includes appropriate indexes for query performance.

### Data Flow Architecture
Let me explain the complete data flow:

First, when a user adds a website, the API validates the input and stores it in PostgreSQL. Then, the Pusher service queries the database every 30 seconds and pushes monitoring jobs to Redis streams. Next, Worker services consume jobs from streams and monitor the websites. The results are then stored back to PostgreSQL by the workers. Finally, the Frontend displays aggregated data served by the API.

### Why This Architecture?
This architecture provides several key benefits:

**Scalability**: Each service can scale independently based on demand. **Reliability**: Service isolation prevents cascading failures across the system. **Performance**: Redis streams provide high-throughput message processing capabilities. **Global Reach**: Multi-region workers eliminate geographical bias in monitoring. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the system easy to understand and modify."

**Redis Optimization**: Redis would be configured with production settings for memory management, persistence configuration for durability, network optimization for performance, and monitoring of key performance indicators.

**Application Performance**: The system would implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data, code optimization for critical paths, resource allocation optimization, and continuous performance monitoring.

#### Security Hardening

**Network Security**: Production security would include network policies for traffic control, service mesh for encrypted communication, proper firewall configuration, and regular security assessments.

**Secret Management**: The system would use external secret management systems, automated secret rotation procedures, proper access controls for sensitive data, and audit logging for secret access.

**Compliance**: Production deployment would ensure GDPR compliance for user data, proper audit trails for regulatory requirements, data retention policies, and regular security audits.

#### Cost Optimization

**Resource Right-Sizing**: Production would implement appropriate resource allocation based on actual usage, horizontal pod autoscaling for cost efficiency, spot instance usage where appropriate, and regular cost analysis and optimization.

**Monitoring and Optimization**: The system would track resource utilization patterns, identify optimization opportunities, implement cost allocation and tracking, and regular review of infrastructure costs.

#### Compliance & Governance

**GDPR Compliance**: The system would implement proper data retention policies, user data export capabilities, data deletion procedures, and consent management for user privacy.

**Audit Requirements**: Production would maintain comprehensive audit logs, proper data access controls, regular compliance assessments, and documentation for regulatory requirements.

This production strategy ensures 99.9% uptime through redundancy and comprehensive monitoring, scalable architecture that grows efficiently with demand, security compliance meeting industry standards, cost optimization through efficient resource usage, and disaster recovery with minimal data loss and rapid restoration capabilities."

## Q&A Preparation Points

### Common Technical Questions & Answers

**Q: How would you handle database scaling as the system grows?**
A: "I would implement read replicas for query distribution, partition the WebsiteTick table by date for better performance, add Redis caching for frequently accessed data, and consider database sharding by user_id for horizontal scaling. The current architecture already supports these enhancements."

**Q: What happens if Redis goes down?**
A: "The system has graceful degradation - workers would continue processing existing jobs but new jobs wouldn't be queued. The pusher service would retry Redis connections, and we could implement a fallback queue mechanism. The monitoring data would still be stored in PostgreSQL, so no data loss would occur."

**Q: How do you ensure data consistency across regions?**
A: "Each region writes to the same central database with proper timestamps and region identification. The system uses eventual consistency for monitoring data, which is acceptable for this use case. Critical user data operations are handled synchronously through the API service."

**Q: What's your strategy for handling high traffic spikes?**
A: "The Kubernetes HPA automatically scales workers based on CPU and memory usage. Redis Streams can handle millions of messages per second, and the database connection pooling prevents connection exhaustion. The stateless design allows for rapid horizontal scaling."

**Q: How would you implement real-time notifications?**
A: "I would add WebSocket support to the API service for real-time dashboard updates, implement push notifications for mobile apps, add email/SMS alerting through external services, and use Redis pub/sub for real-time event distribution across services."

**Q: What monitoring and alerting would you add for production?**
A: "I would implement Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for visualization, AlertManager for alerting, distributed tracing with Jaeger, centralized logging with ELK stack, and custom business metrics for monitoring effectiveness and user satisfaction."
